## Description

This website takes numbers as an input, and outputs the roman numeral equivalent. We used HTML, jQuery, and JavaScript.

## Behaviors

| Spec| Example input | Example Output
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| An entered number is converted into it's corresponding symbol | "10" | "X" |
| the entered number will equal the sum of all symbols | "60" | "LX" |
| Symbols are displayed largest to smallest | "1111" | "MCXI" |
| if the sum of all symbols requires more than 3 consecutive cases of the same symbol, use subtraction to reach the sum of consecutive values. | "4" | "IV" |
| ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands need to evaulate separately. | "99" | "XCIX" (not: "IC") |
| If a non-integer is entered, return an error | "325hello" | "enter a number between 1-3999" |
| Entered numbers must be between 1-3999 | "4000" | "enter a number between 1-3999" |
